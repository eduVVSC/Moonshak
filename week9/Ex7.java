/*
Write a program that reads an integer N (0 <= N <= 100000000) and an integer X (0 <= X <= 100000000) and determines how many of the positive numbers from zero to N (inclusive) have the sum of the factorials of the its digits greater than X.

Implement an efficient solution.

example: for N=5 and X=10
0 : 0! =1
1 : 1! =1
2 : 2! =2
3 : 3! =6
4 : 4! =24
5 : 5! =120
output: 2
